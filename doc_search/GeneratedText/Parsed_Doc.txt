Home Automation Security and VulnerabilitiesSpring 2014EEL4789  Ethical Hacking and CountermeauresDr Alexander PonsbyHenry FlefelLuis PucheElvin BlenMiguel San MartinJoseph HickmanPg 1In 2012 a survey conducted by the National Association of Home Builders showedthat home automation was listed as one of the most desired features in a new homeTodays home automation systems are capable of controlling just about any devices in ahome This is made possible through the use of several different control protocols the mostpopular being the ZWave protocol In 2012 the market for home automation was a 34billion dollar industry with nearly 15 million systems having been shipped to consumersBy the year 2017 the market size is expect to grow to 55 billion dollars and the estimatenumber of system shipped to consumers will be 80 million With so many homes beginningto use these system one is compelled to ask the question Are these system secureLast year the Federal Trade Commission received more than onequarter millionstolen identity complaintsand thats just the reported case Marian Merritt NortonIdentity Theft Primer For a malicious hacker to gather the required information foridentity theft purposes is not hard That is if the victim is not aware of how easy they aremaking this process for them Besides usual wireless network sniffing email scams andother cracking procedures home automation has introduced quite a few more tools formischievous objectivesOne of the most common features of smart homes is audio and video capabilitiesAmong other amenities like smart air conditioning and lights security surveillance is theusual tool for people who want to protect valuables sensitive information safeguard lovedones or simply automate process that require supervision But this technology comes witha price much bigger than the monetary one Privacy can be invaded by a criminal and theinformation that he or she can gather goes beyond bits and bytes What you eat movies youwatch your daily schedule and other information can be collected if someone cracks intoyour home surveillance system which most automated homes have home server whichmost automated houses use to support the system or any other information cluster youuse For example if your credit card information in stolen it would be suspicious if it isused to buy a car or something small but delivered to another address But what wouldhappen if the attacker buys a TV from amazon and asks to be shipped at your own addresswhen he or she knows you are not at home It is just a matter of timing and waiting for acouple of minutes for UPS to arrive with the package and steal it from your doorstep Youknow it wasnt you but for Amazon UPS and your bank it looks absolutely normalMany other techniques and attacks can be performed with information gatheredfrom smart homes so it is important to know what to do to prevent it Check for shouldersurfers when entering PIN numbers or other sensible data Also destroy any data storagedevice properly especially if it is encrypted People tend to think that due to encryptionyou are save to throw away your CD but what you are doing is actually giving away thenecessary parts for someone to decipher the key saving time for when they crack into yournetwork and find an encrypted drive in your server to which they will already have thekey For CDs microwave is the best bet For drives a shredder or multipass writer is aprogram that rewrites the information in different ways and multiple times before cleaningthe bits to all ceros Magnetic drives such as Hard Disk Drives have other techniques ofPg 2data recovery so the microwave or directly drilling holes in it will fully destroy it Thisinformation is collected by dumpsterdiving so try to keep your trash can inside yourgarage until the cleaning personnel comes to collect them Knowing what not to do is alsoimportant No reputable business or agency will send you an unsolicited email requestingpersonal or financial information from you Internet Security article fromwwwidentitytheftinfo Much more information is available from that site and manyothers A practical list can be found at httpnetsecurityaboutcom  but remember toinform yourself about the security risks and best methods to be safe from time to time asthey evolve with timeBest Practices in Home NetworksAnyone may ask how do I secure my home from trespassers With the risingpopularity of Smart Homes and connectivity to the internet one could say that homes canbecome bigger and better targets the more integrated they becomePort Forwarding This is one of the most commonly used methods to output eitherSmart home systems or CCTV Security Cameras Done usually at the gateway of the homethe modem is bridged and everything is managed at the routerThe DVR might be easily compromisable as users tend to either not change theadministrator passwords Even more alarming is the number of loopholes that come withcamera systems Personally having worked on the field most chinesemade DVRs haveways to access their content with backdoor passwords Commonly Anonymous andAnonymous to gain full access to all functionsFor the main players in a Smart Home environment a common practice for installerswas to port forward directly to the system ports Some of these completely unsecured andallowing realtime modifications through the use of proprietary programs that werecracked and available on the net At this point anything within a home could be controlledremotely blinds door locks gates and garages all compromisedSo what might be the alternative Simply put a VPN is more secure for a smarthome however more costly to setup or the proprietary service that companies offer toaccess their own systemsSecuring Network Wirelessly Having a strong WPA2 security with WPS modedisabled can make a huge difference As we have learned WEP is unsecured and some ofthe older Automation Systems only work through WEP encryption systems that sometimeshave not been updated to a more secure encryptionHowever the most secure of encryptions can be cracked by social engineeringGuests in a home are often given the WiFi password this is a problem when the systemitself is connected to the same network and once unsecured anyone nearby can gainaccess Providing any of these details will always be a risk and for that if theres anyPg 3suspicion that the wireless will be left alone then changing the password frequently is oneof the best practicesEthernet based This is the obvious how about intercoms Some intercoms arewired directly If a person with a screwdriver can go over to the gate remove the intercomand connect directly to the home network to then disable security and stop the camerasthen the whole home is open for robbery Outdoor antennas are the same one could freelygain access from an unsecured antenna and connect their own access pointPaying attention to which wires are exposed is critical having equipment insidewalls will make it unlikely that anyone will try to break in Installing sensors thatimmediately alert the homeowner that that the intercom has been opened can make a hugedifferenceWhat to remember For most systems the network is the first and the only line ofdefense is the network itself Taking special care of plugging all the holes in your ownnetwork should be any homeowners priority as we sink deeper into the controlled homeenvironmentLooking through a set of black glassesHackers are everywhere attempting to compromise our information for illintentioned actions such as stealing our credit card information for the obvious purposesocial security numbers and just about any information that may be valuable to youblackmail perhaps or them As the smarthome industry rises there is greater risk ofhackers compromising and entering what we once thought of as sacred ground ourhome How does this work exactly Let us take a quick look at how a black hat aka hackerwill most likely go through the process of breaking in by walking through a door or windowcompletely unnoticed or without an alarm First heshe scouts for a prospect most likelysomeone who has nice material objects is somewhat flashy with their assets after findinga subject heshe will start on reconnaissance legally andor illegally to provide a moresolid background on you and learn the ins and outs of your schedulelifestyle aftergathering all this information they will develop a strategy on attacking your home andexecute that planTools of the tradeSo once all the planning is set exactly how does it work Well like we allknow the internet is full of viruses and malware that can reap our information and causeharm to our computers smarthomes are now on the menu for viruses and malwarebecause smarthomes use technology involving radio waves and protocols that can becompromised just like any other computer The US market for smarthomes is nearlyentirely occupied 80 by devices equipped with the ZWave protocol which is nowknown to be quite vulnerable to attack How does the attack work though There is a smallcircuit board that can pick up the radio wave frequencies that the ZWave protocol useswhich can be easily equipped to a laptop via serial communication what does this meanPg 4This means that a hacker can view all the packets in the air being sent from a homeownerto their smarthomes and access information critical to the security of that house includingthe ID of the ZWave home device A hacker would then use ZForce software developed toread and inject packets to a ZWave home device to literally tell the front door to unlockand maybe even turn on the light while disabling the alarm Now there are a few steps inorder to complete the somewhat simple attack which consists of1Identify the home ID of the ZWave smarthome device2Use the settemporary key command and confirm the device is nowrunning your temporary key3Now that you and the home device have the same key sendcommands overAs you can see its not much This is a pretty easy way of literally walking into thebank and taking all that you can without a security guard telling you otherwiseZWave is an ITU certified proprietary communication protocol that was developedby Sigma Designs for use in home automation systems It uses a lowpower wirelesstechnology design that makes it ideal for remote control applications in low cost homecontrol networks The protocols primary function is to communicate short controlmessages in an efficient and dependable manner from a controlling device to one or morecompatible devices in the network The protocol was designed with two main device typescategorized as controlling devices and slave nodes The controlling devices send outcommands to other devices in the network while the slave nodes can either executereceived commands or forward commands intended for other slave nodes located outsideof the controlling devices signal range There can only be on primary or master controllingdevice in a given network This controller is the only device that is capable of adding andremoving other devices on the network This ensures that the master controller always hascomplete knowledge of the network topology Every Zwave network has a 32 bit uniqueidentifier also know as Home ID This ID is used to maintain different Zwave networksseparate This Home ID is preprogrammed into all control devices All slave nodes initiallyhave the Home ID set to zero Before a slave node can communicate on a Zwave network itmust first be assigned a Home ID by the controller on that networkIn July 2013 at the annual Black Hat conference security researchers BehrangFouladi Sahand Ghanoun presented their security assessment of the popular Zwaveprotocol Their research found two security vulnerabilities in the Zwave protocol thatwould potentially allow an attacker to control slave nodes installed in a ZWave homeautomation network By using a fairly inexpensive RF transceiver from Texas Instrumentmodel CC1110 and software utility called ZForce an attacker could sniff the Zwaveprotocol communication in any network This will allow an attacker to start building anetwork map of the nodes installed as well as obtaining the 32 bit unique Home IDThe first security vulnerability was found to be in the protocol used when addingslave nodes for the first time to the network Zwave uses a Custom Key EstablishmentProtocol to deliver a new encryption key from the controller to the slave node so that allPg 5future communication can be encrypted However instead of using publickeycryptography to encrypt and send the new key the controller and node use a temporarypreshared key to encrypt the new key This set key message could be intercepted anddecrypted using the ZForce utility This vulnerability was not considered critical since itwould require any potential attacker to be in close proximity when the slave node wasbeing added However an installer could exploit this vulnerability and later use theinformation to mount an attack at a later timeThe second security vulnerability a by far the most dangers was found in thecommunications between slave nodes and controls The research should that the slavenodes did not authenticate communication coming from controllers If an attacker was toinject a set message with a new Home ID the slave node would accept the packet andregister with the controller even though it was already registered with another Home IDThis would allow an attacker to install a rouge controller or use the ZForce software tosend control commands to the devicesEducating Your Children About Social Engineering Therefore Less Reliance onTechnology Against Hackers and Better Home ProtectionItems that protect your children when they are home safety Latches and LocksAntiScald devices smoke detectors window guards edge bumpers outlet covers doorstops and holders and most importantly a web filter All of these are technological itemsbut what about the socialintellectual side of security Many have heard of the manytechnological advances in home security and the many ways hackers circumvent thesedefensive measures but given that our children and teens are losing the concept of privacyvia social media and are always connected it is easier for a hacker to invade your homethe private domain where every member of the family should be secure in all dimensionsNot to mention what are we protecting is just our privacy and possessions what about themind and the minds of the children More than anything you guard protect your mind forlife flows from itGiven that the home is the fortress its greatest weakness is not just thechildrenteens that inhabit it but that fact that everything is connected Organized crimehas gone to the internet to steal more than what is possess in the home just attackers whomay want to hurt children and teens The primary threats to juveniles in the home todayare their peers cyberbullying via social media and adults that would want to harm themSince every device has a keyboard screen camera and microphone surrounding everyoneincluding children there obvious positive use is selfrevealing but its possible use as agateway to harm is not Computers do automatic updates and antivirus programs arerunning and firewalls are up but what if the attacker already has access to your childrenwhich is often the case Just as it is unrealistic to block every communications port on yourcomputer and still be productive it is just as unrealistic to block your childs every mediumto the outside world The primary method of attack in a social engineering attack isa prolonged communications with the targetvictim As the target develops trust in theattacker the attacker get closer to obtaining their goalPg 6The best defense is education educating children on the threats they face and howthey should react Train them to ask themselves critical questions such as how well do Ireally know this person why would they ask me certain questions should I ask my parentsfor their opinion Teach them how information is valuable asset and that they should shareas little as possible Teenagers often act impulsively without giving complete and properthought to the consequences Educate them on how to create a proper password what isgenerally safe to download log out of systems when they are done and configuring privacysettings Most importantly being open and honest through constructive nonemotionalconversations The children of the future will need to taught the importance of privacy andhow to maintain it Unfortunately parents must also conduct their own surveillancegradually decreasing such surveillance as children grow older wiser and more trustworthyand increase surveillance if the inverse is true Just as children are educated to be vigilanton the street they should be equally as vigilant while using the internet and that justbecause they are in the physical safety of the home that physical safety can be threatenedby their actions virtuallyThere is no substitute for good parenting Much like many corporations haveCounterespionage divisions electronic surveillance departments and security training atthe end of day individual wisdom and education are the only true defenses against
