HackingAbstract We will be analyzing a variety of different network encryptions and discussing how tobreach said networks We aspire to create an accurate and useful analysis of network standards and will suggest ways to improve these networks Improvements proposed will be made using thorough research into the subject area Each networking encryption standard will also be thoroughly discussed in the following paperIntroduction In this paper we are going to look at a few of the different network related securities thathave come along since the Introduction of the Wireless Local Area Network WLAN and their various weaknessesMainly we will be discussing topics varying from the open encryption to nonencryption methods which may depend on software encryption https etc to protect data As well as the easily broken Wired Equivalent Privacy WEP and then the WiFi Protected Access WPA followed by the WiFi Protected Access II WPA2 we are going to explore and discuss proper procedures for maintaining high levels of security in order to keep the user protectedWired Equivalent Privacy WEP The first and original security for wireless access points that was created in 1997 In2001 however it was discovered that WEP had serious flaws those flaws being that a passive attack could be launched to decrypt traffic based on statistical analysis of the data stream active attacks could be launched to inject malicious traffic from an unauthorized workstation or to decrypt traffic based on simply tricking the access point This was all possible as it used a stream cipher Stream ciphers operate by expanding a specific key into an extremely long random false key The sender and receiver receive similar keys then theyre converted to plain text As long as both match the data is secure Decrypting said key though is something now of childs play howeverWEP is generally no longer used anywhere as it has been far depreciated One of the reasons that wep is so easy to crack is that it uses a manually entered 40 or 104bit encryption key This is actually one of the first things improved upon in the WPA network A standard WEP key normally concatenates a 24bit initialization vector to form the RC4 key usedfor confidentiality The main problem with the encryption key is that it is manually entered unlike tkip which puts a temporary key for each packet of dataOne way to start breaching a WEP security network is to use a packetsniffing program on linux It is better to use linux than windows because it can actually sniff WEP packets One of the most commonlyused programs to accomplish this is backtrack Through this program and several commands it is possible to find hidden SSIDs and the type of encryption each network usesWiFi Protected Access WPA WPA is not its own form of new security It was created to be a wrapper to WEP tosafeguard WEP from the flaws that were found with it It was never meant to be its own defining security standard just a stopgap until WPA2 was ready for deployment WPA works in two secure modes One being WPAPSK and the other being WPAEnterprise The former is simply a preshared key while the latter requires a RADIUS server and can be combined with an EAP Extensible Authentication Protocol WPA also generally uses TKIP or Temporal Key Integrity Protocol it is not an encryption protocol but it does make sure every packet of data is sent with a unique key something that WEP desperately lacked However as most consumers simply use WPAPSK brute forcing the passcode was a quick and effective way of retrieving the specific user key WPA is somewhat still used today in older systems that have not been migrated over to WPA2 mostly due to owner complacencyThere are flaws associated with WPA In order to recognize these flaws it is important to understand the software capabilities WPA includes a message integrity check This is designed to prevent an attacker from capturing altering andor resending data packets WPA uses a message integrity check algorithm called Michael to verify the integrity of the packets However Michael is not as strong as the algorithm used in WPA2 WPA relies on outdated weaknesses in WEP that can be exploited only for the TKIP algorithm and the limitations of Michael to retrieve the keystream from short packets to use for reinjection This very WPA quality is what fuels one of its major security weaknesses The flaw can only decrypt short packets with mostly known contents such as ARP messages The attack requires Quality of Service to be enabled which allows packet prioritization as defined The flaw does not lead to recovery of a key but only to recovery of a keystream that was used to encrypt a particular packet and which can be reused as many as seven times to inject arbitrary data of the same packet length to a wireless clientWPA and 80211i provide for a PreShared Key PSK as an alternative to 8021X based key establishment When a PSK is used instead of 8021X the PSK is the Pairwise Master KeyPMK that is used to drive the 4way handshake and the whole Pairwise Transient Key PTK keying hierarchy Anyone with knowledge of the PSK can determine any PTK in the ESS through passive sniffing of the wireless network listening for key exchange data frames Also if a weak passphrase is used for example a short passphrase an offline dictionary attack can readily guess the PSK Since the common usage will be a single PSK for the ESS once this is learned by the attacker the attacker is now a member of the ESS and the whole ESS is compromised The attacker can now read and forge any traffic in the ESS80211i standard WPA2 WPA2 is the proper follow up to WEP It runs in the same modes as WPA but instead ofusing TKIP it uses CCMP for cryptographic encapsulation CCMP was designed to have data completely confidential this is based upon the Counter Mode with CCM CBCMAC of the AES encryption standard This is used to replace TKIP for message confidentiality and makes WPA lose many of its flaws WPA2 is what is generally used now by default in most if not all consumer networks It is the most secure mainstream security measure an average consumer can deploy However its largest weak point would be the use of an easy passkey like password or 123456In April 2003 the WiFi Alliance introduced WPA based on draft 3 of the IEEE 80211i amendment which was designed to replace the much weaker WEP encryption without requiring hardware replacements At the time WPA used strong cryptography support from TKIP based on the RC 4 cipher By leveraging the RC 4 cipher the IEEE 80211i task group was able to improve the security on legacy networks until the IEEE 80211i amendment was completed Although there have been no catastrophic security breaches reported on the WPATKIP protocol it was only intended provide enough security for 5 years while organizations transitioned to the full IEEE 80211i security mechanismWPA2 adopted many of the same encryptions methods used for WPA but in addition implements the mandatory elements of IEEE 80211i WPA2 improves the security of WiFi connections by requiring the use of stronger wireless encryption than what WPA requires Specifically WPA2 does not allow use of TKIP which has known security holes but instead introduces CCMP a new AESbased encryption mode with strong security CCMP is an enhanced data cryptographic encapsulation mechanism designed for data confidentiality and addresses the vulnerabilities present in WPAWPA was designed to work with wireless hardware produced prior to the introduction ofthe WPA protocol but the newer WPA2 is not supported on older hardware products Beginning in 2004 certification by the WiFi Alliance began and as of March 13 2006 WPA2 is mandatory for all new devices to bear the WiFi trademark The current wireless security standard today is WPA2 which uses an encryption device that encrypts the network with a 256bit key improving security over WEP and WPA by having a longer key lengthNonEncryption Methods Unencrypted networks are usually found in coffee shops libraries airports hotelsuniversities and other public places and are convenient free access points for users within their confines to be granted internet access This complete lack of security makes it very easy to setup the network on a users device but at the same time if the user is not using an encrypted site their data can be easily read with something like WireShark which is completely free and works on all operating systems This can lead to fraud and other financial complications for the userService set identifier or more commonly knows as SSID SSID is what your network uses to identify itself to local devices If you prevent your network from broadcasting its SSID to all local devices said devices will not be able to see it readily available Hence this in terms allows local users from being able to access the network without knowing its SSID first This however has many shortcomings as one can easily find an SSID without having it be broadcasted by the networkAnother nonencryption method is MAC ID filtering this form of filtering allows you to specify a set MAC address from your device and allow it on the unsecured network Since MAC addresses are unique this can be considered a good precaution to have on smaller networks However due to a criminal possibly sniffing out a valid MAC address and then using MAC address spoofing criminals can ultimately pretend to be a preapproved MAC address and gain access to your networkStatic IP addressing allows you to filter out casual users by making a technical barrier a requirement this barrier being that the user must assign himself a static ip However this provides little to no protection as would be hackers know how to do such things as well as they know breathing and sleepingConclusion There are many ways for data to be compromised and in order to reduce the risk ofdelicate information falling into the wrong hands We must follow proper procedures that helpreduce the chances of this occurring This can be accomplished by using the safest network encryption currently available In this case said encryption is WPA2 WPA2 contains a crucial flaw though its users password For WPA2 to function correctly users must must take the extra time to set up their network with a strong password Once this is done it can make it almost impossible for potential hackers to break into said private networks hence preserving your information from outside accessAlthough there isnt a way to ever make data 100 secure whether it be digital or analogue you can make it as difficult to obtain by others as possible This combined with user knowledge goes a long way in the digital security world and in other aspects of our life as wellReferences 1 WiFi
