describing multiparticipant interactive simulations  virtual worlds networked via the global Internet andhyperlinked with the World Wide Web All aspects of virtual world display interactionand internetworking can be specified using VRML It is the intention of its designers thatVRML become the standard language for interactive simulation within the World WideWebThe first version of VRML allows for the creation of virtual worlds with limitedinteractive behavior These worlds can contain objects which have hyperlinks to otherworlds HTML documents or other valid MIME types When the user selects an objectwith a hyperlink the appropriate MIME viewer is launched When the user selects a linkto a VRML document from within a correctly configured WWW browser a VRMLviewer is launched Thus VRML viewers are the perfect companion applications tostandard WWW browsers for navigating and visualizing the Web Future versions ofVRML will allow for richer behaviors including animations motion physics and realtime multiuser interactionThis document specifies the features and syntax of Version 10 of VRMLVRML Mission StatementThe history of the development of the Internet has had three distinct phases first thedevelopment of the TCPIP infrastructure which allowed documents and data to be storedin a proximally independent way that is Internet provided a layer of abstraction betweendata sets and the hosts which manipulated them While this abstraction was useful it wasalso confusing without any clear sense of what went where access to Internet wasrestricted to the class of sysopsnet surfers who could maintain internal cognitive maps ofthe data spaceNext Tim BernersLees work at CERN where he developed the hypermedia systemknown as World Wide Web added another layer of abstraction to the existing structureThis abstraction provided an addressing scheme a unique identifier the UniversalResource Locator which could tell anyone where to go and how to get there for anypiece of data within the Web While useful it lacked dimensionality theres no therethere within the web and the only type of navigation permissible other than surfing isby direct reference In other words I can only tell you how to get to the VRML Forumhome page by saying httpwwwwiredcom which is not humancentered data Infact I need to make an effort to remember it at all So while the World Wide Webprovides a retrieval mechanism to complement the existing storage mechanism it leavesa lot to be desired particularly for human beingsAPPROVEDFinally we move to perceptualized Internetworks where the data has been sensualizedthat is rendered sensually If something is represented sensually it is possible to makesense of it VRML is an attempt how successful only time and effort will tell to placehumans at the center of the Internet ordering its universe to our whims In order to dothat the most important single element is a standard that defines the particularities ofperception Virtual Reality Modeling Language is that standard designed to be auniversal description language for multiparticipant simulationsThese three phases storage retrieval and perceptualization are analogous to the humanprocess of consciousness as expressed in terms of semantics and cognitive scienceEvents occur and are recorded memory inferences are drawn from memoryassociations and from sets of related events maps of the universe are created cognitiveperception What is important to remember is that the map is not the territory and weshould avoid becoming trapped in any single representation or worldview Although weneed to design to avoid disorientation we should always push the envelope in the kindsof experience we can bring into manifestationThis document is the living proof of the success of a process that was committed to beingopen and flexible responsive to the needs of a growing Web community Rather than reinvent the wheel we have adapted an existing specification Open Inventor as the basisfrom which our own work can grow saving years of design work and perhaps manymistakes Now our real work can begin that of rendering our noospheric spaceHistoryVRML was conceived in the spring of 1994 at the first annual World Wide WebConference in Geneva Switzerland Tim BernersLee and Dave Raggett organized aBirdsofaFeather BOF session to discuss Virtual Reality interfaces to the World WideWeb Several BOF attendees described projects already underway to build threedimensional graphical visualization tools which interoperate with the Web Attendeesagreed on the need for these tools to have a common language for specifying 3D scenedescription and WWW hyperlinks  an analog of HTML for virtual reality The termVirtual Reality Markup Language VRML was coined and the group resolved to beginspecification work after the conference The word Markupwas later changed toModelingto reflect the graphical nature of VRMLAPPROVEDShortly after the Geneva BOF session the wwwvrml mailing list was created to discussthe development of a specification for the first version of VRML The response to the listinvitation was overwhelming within a week there were over a thousand members Afteran initial settlingin period list moderator Mark Pesce of Labyrinth Group announced hisintention to have a draft version of the specification ready by the WWW Fall 1994conference a mere five months away There was general agreement on the list that whilethis schedule was aggressive it was achievable provided that the requirements for thefirst version were not too ambitious and that VRML could be adapted from an existingsolution The list quickly agreed upon a set of requirements for the first version andbegan a search for technologies which could be adapted to fit the needs of VRMLThe search for existing technologies turned up a several worthwhile candidates Aftermuch deliberation the list came to a consensus the Open Inventor ASCII File Formatfrom Silicon Graphics Inc The Inventor File Format supports complete descriptions of3D scenes with polygonally rendered objects lighting materials ambient properties andrealism effects A subset of the Inventor File Format with extensions to supportnetworking forms the basis of VRML Gavin Bell of Silicon Graphics has adapted theInventor File Format for VRML with design input from the mailing list SGI has publiclystated that the file format is available for use in the open market and have contributed afile format parser into the public domain to bootstrap VRML viewer developmentA Graphical Representation of Inverse VRML
