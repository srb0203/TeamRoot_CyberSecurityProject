Dear Mr. Bickle,

This letter is in regard to a recall we have announced regarding one of our
products, the Data-PDA. We recently found that the memory chip that is used in this
product fails under heavy use. We understand that this is a major issue for you as a
representative for EEI, and we wish to correct the problem as quickly as possible.

The data chip fails as the result of a manufacturing issue, which has been
corrected. Replacement chips have already been produced. We would greatly
appreciate it if you would ship all unsold units of the Data-PDA back to our EEI
manufacturing plants in New Jersey so that we can replace the faulty chip. We will then
ship the units back to your stores, and reimburse you for the initial shipping costs.

EEI would also be grateful if you would please direct your store managers to
instruct anyone who has a PDA with the faulty chip to ship their unit back to EEI at the
following address for a free upgrade:

Thank you for your understanding and your cooperation in resolving this matter.

Best Regards,

Chip Perlo
